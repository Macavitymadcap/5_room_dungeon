Legend tells of a dungeon not far from town beneath Mt. Bryntor said to contain treasures of incalculable wealth.
Incalculable not only because no one knows what the treasures are, but also because none have such wealth with which the treasures could be compared.
Chief among the dungeon's claims to fame, however, is that no one has ever retrieved the treasures contained therein.
For the dungeon is filled with perilous puzzles, tyrannous traps, mighty monsters and other such alliterative dangers.
And so you head off out of town in search of wealth, glory, and (most importantly) the entrance to the dungeon.
